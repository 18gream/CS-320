# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  Following secure coding practices, deploying testing, and doing regular updates to the software are all ways to ensure the program is functional and secure. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? 
  Gathering the user needs through strategies like interviews or observation and then analyze each requirement to interpret any needs from the user. Understanding and thoroughly anaylzing the requirements is a huge part in incorporating the user needs into the program, as you do not want to miss any. Then, testing the program to ensure that the code meets the user requirements will ensure that each need is met. 

# How do I approach designing software?
  Gathering user needs and requirements is one step in designing software as this tells us where we need to start and what to implement into our design. Then, generating the solution and steps that will be needed to solve the user needs will be a step in designing software. Build code that relies on the user needs and test the code to make sure it meets all requirements.
